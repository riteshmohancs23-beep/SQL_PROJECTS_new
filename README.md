# ðŸ“Š Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project**!  
This repository demonstrates the design, implementation, and management of a data warehouse solution for efficient data storage, integration, and analysis.  

The project focuses on:  
- Building a structured and scalable **data warehouse architecture**.  
- Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from multiple sources.  
- Designing **fact and dimension tables** for analytical processing.  
- Enabling advanced reporting and **business intelligence (BI) insights**.  

This project serves as a practical reference for students, data engineers, and analytics enthusiasts interested in learning how data warehouses support **decision-making and data-driven strategies**.
